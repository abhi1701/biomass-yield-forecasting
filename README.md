**Utility of Domain Adaptation for Biomass Yield Forecasting**
**Description**

This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) and domain adaptation (DA) techniques to forecast future alfalfa yields. By utilizing a novel technique, we aim to predict alfalfa yield time series data, focusing on forecasting differences in yields rather than absolute yield values. The approach has shown promising results compared to traditional ARIMA models, particularly in handling multivariate time series where factors such as weather and climate variations play a significant role.
